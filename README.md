# Angular Ninja Overview

We would like to develop a brand-new angular ninja game.
The purpose of the game is to find all the shuriken located in the maze.
The maze is built from an 8\*8 matrix that can contain:

Tile – an empty space that can either contain our ninja or a shuriken.

Wall – the ninja cannot walk through the walls and cannot contain a shuriken.

The player can use the arrow in the keyboard to move the ninja around the maze to locate all the shuriken.
The game ends when there are no more shurikens left to find.
Your task is to build an angular application that implements this new game.
You can use online editor: https://codesandbox.io/
The assets for our amazing game are located here:
https://github.com/Yogev-Varonis/Varonis-Ninja/tree/main/src/assets

What we are looking for:
Design skills, correct classes, components, clean code, reusability, and scalability.
